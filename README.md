## About This project (Some TL;DR)
- I'm obsessed with being up-to-date, and will review and update my files once in a while. If you see a change, got a feedback, or got a bank or gateway and want to see your logo in my file, awesome! Contact me :)

- I put a considerable amount of time and effort on creating flawless and updated file for each platform. Every logo you see here has been manually traced, nodes and layers managed. I managed to get a few ones using the formal sources like their websites, or bank-related companies, and used the ones with good quality in my file.

- Want to spread the world? Wow how nice of you ^_^ Use this hashtag in your tweets and stories: **#logos_project**

- Hate github and want to use another source which is ...more aligned with your sense of beauty maybe? Oh well, I'll submit and update my files in the following websites too: [Uplabs](https://uplabs.com/zegond) and [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/zegond).

**Resizing Issues in Sketch**

Sketch tends to misplace the layers inside a shape when scaling. (Pay attention to petals below)

![2019-07-25_17-18-29.gif](https://s3.gifyu.com/images/2019-07-25_17-18-29.gif)

To avoid this, insert symbol, scale to desired size, and detach from symbol *after* resize.

**Changing Style of Monocolor Logos**

Monocolors have styles set in their shape, which means you can easily switch them with the ones you have in your document or your other libraries.

**Adding a file as Library**

Figma uses team projects to manage libraries, so you can add the file as a library using the menu on the top left under "Libraries". Having a public link is a paid feature, so I'm afraid, you have to update your files manualy.

### SVG Assets
The SVG Icon files have been created with viewbox enabled in them in 48px boundary. This makes all of the containers stay in the middle of a square box which makes managing their size and position easier.
below you can see the comparison between an SVG image without (Left) and with viewbox (right)

![Untitled-1cfd05ad380f70e51.jpg](https://s3.gifyu.com/images/Untitled-1cfd05ad380f70e51.jpg)

SVG groups have also been carefully considered to avoid unwanted clutter.
